//! Assignment-60: Hashing

//? 1. To store student records use hash table data structure. Define a class Student with member variables rollNumber, name, stream, year. Also define appropriate member function to handle Student class.

//? 2. Define a structure node with member variables item of type Student and next pointer.

//? 3. Define a class HashTable with member variables capacity, a node pointer to point an array of node pointers (refer Question 2). Implement hashing with the help of open hashing method.

//? 4. Define a hashFunction which takes roll number as a key and return index number of the array of node pointers (refer Question 3).

//? 5. Define a function to insert Student data in the Hash Table

//? 6. Define a search function to find the Student data using rollNumber
